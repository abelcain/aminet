```disk.info
Utilities.info
Utilities
Utilities/MultiView.info
Utilities/MultiView```

Based on 'depth-first search' principles what do we know? 

a) We know that 'utilities' is on root;
b) we know that 'utilities' is a directory;
c) we know that 'utilities' has a file extension named '.info';
d) we know that 'utilities' has a file named 'MultiView' which has an '.info' extension;

Let's build the SQL structure that might represent it fully


TABLE A			
1	dir	NULL	
2	file	NULL	
3	info	1	
4	info	2	

TABLE B			
1	Utilities	NULL	3
2	Multiview	1	4
3   disk  NULL4

regarding the structure what do we know?
a) if it has a slash, it's a directory;
b) that we have both directories and files with file extension named '.info'
c) if it has no slash, it's a file.
d) in one line it might have no slash if it is repeated elsewhere with a slash



TABLE A			
1	dir	NULL	
2	file	NULL	
3	info	1	
4	info	2	

I have table A set in mysql and accessible from script.
```import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="root",
  password=r"90'+iopÂº",
  database="GPT"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

mycursor.execute("SELECT id FROM FileTypes WHERE type = '.info'")

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()

print(myresult)
````
```disk.info
Utilities.info
Utilities
Utilities/MultiView.info
Utilities/MultiView```

I want to check the extensions against the table. if there's an extension it should be added to the table and then pick.

A Table B named DirectoryStructure exists where the parsed data should be added:
TABLE B			
1	Utilities	NULL	3
2	Multiview	1	4
3   disk  NULL  4
DirectoryStructure
'id', 'name','parent_id','type'


I got:
disk.info
Utilities.info
Utilities
Utilities
	MultiView.info
Utilities
	MultiView

can I improve it so that I got:
disk.info
Utilities.info
Utilities
	MultiView.info
	MultiView
